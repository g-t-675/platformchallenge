# Load balancer for the services 

I'm using Traefik as a load balancer for the services due to it's simplicity and being cloud-native, easy to scale and much more flexible to work with as compared to nginx and/or apache. 

There's also a sample of how HTTPS certificates work with Traefik, which generates them automatically using a letsencrypt resolver and basically replaces a certbot + automation on it's own.
